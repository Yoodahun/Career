# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/hackerthon/workspace/.bundle
/Personal_BLOG/Exhibition/workspace/.bundle


# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/hackerthon/workspace/db/*.sqlite3
/hackerthon/workspace/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/Personal_BLOG/Exhibition/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/Personal_BLOG/Exhibition/db/*.sqlite3




# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/hackerthon/workspace/log/*
/hackerthon/workspace!/log/.keep
/hackerthon/workspace/tmp
